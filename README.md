1. chart.js + swiper.js
   During my work, I created a component that combines Chart.js and Swiper.js. This integration allows for interactive charts that users can swipe through, providing a dynamic and engaging way to present data. This combination leverages Chart.js for its versatile charting capabilities, including line, bar, pie charts, and more, alongside Swiper.js for its responsive, touch-sensitive sliding features. This hybrid component is primarily used in front-end development to enhance user interfaces with visually appealing and interactive data visualizations.
